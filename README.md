# EasyRAG.js

EasyRAG is the AI library you wish you had when you got started.

## Getting Started

Please note that this library is in active development, and the API is not yet stable. No NPM packages have been published. If you are interested in using this library, you will need to install it from source.

## Documentation

Documentation is currently under development. Check back soon for updates.

## Why & Ethos

I created this library as an alternative to existing tools due to increasing frustration with them. EasyRAG aims to:

- Provide a minimal API abstraction to easily build a variety of AI-powered applications.
- Be extendable out-of-the-box. Create your own adapters and integrate with any inference engine (Ollama, LlamaIndex, etc.)
- Throw errors instead of falling back to defaults.

## Feature Roadmap

I am committed to releasing the following features:

- [x] Model Adapter
  - [x] Chat completion

  - [x] Support for parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.)
