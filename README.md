## EasyRAG.js

Building AI powered applications shouldn't be difficult. Swapping new models in and out should be easy. EasyRAG.js is an unopinionated JavaScript library that makes it easy to build your next AI inspired idea.

EasyRAG is the AI library you wish you had when you got started.

## Why & Ethos
I created this library as an alternative to the overly complicated alteratives. 

 - Provide a minimal API abstraction to easily build a variety of AI powered applications.
 - Extendable out-of-the-box.

## Feature Roadmap



## Getting Started

Please note that this library is in active development, and the API is not mature enough to be considered stable. I have not published any NPM packages yet. If you are interested in using this library, you will need to install from source.
